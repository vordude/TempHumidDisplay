# TempHumidDisplay
Arduino sketch for temp and humidity displayed on an i2c display

Currently working with SHT11 sensors, specifically this one: http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Soil-Moisture-Temperature-Sensor-p-1356.html?cPath=25_27

Everything is still very much in progress.  The display is a crutch for now, eventually working for GPRS integration, posting data periodcially, and using low pwer stuff.
